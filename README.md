# r-bridge-2019
Materials for the R portion of the Statistics Department 2019 Summer Bridge Program. Scroll down to see instructions for how to get the materials and install software.

Materials for learning R for the August 2019 Statistics Summer Bridge program at UC Berkeley. See below (under the listing of files) for information about the R materials, including logistics, how to get the course content, and how to install the software you need on your laptop.

## Description

### Overview

Topics will include:

 * R basics - reading and manipulating data, working with R data objects, doing calculations, making plots
 * programming in R
 * doing statistical work in R
 * using the Tidyverse suite of R packages

No prior experience with R or programming is expected.

## Logistics - when, where, and how

## Preparing for the course - course content

Course content is available through Github. Please download a copy of the course materials before arriving at the bootcamp using one of the two options below (if you're familiar with Git you'll also know how to do this by cloning the repository):

  1) Simply download a zip file containing all the content at https://github.com/berkeley-scf/r-bridge-2019/archive/master.zip.

  2) If you have Git installed on your laptop, you can get the materials through RStudio. Open RStudio and go to “File→New Project” and select “Version Control” and “Git”. Enter 'https://github.com/berkeley-scf/r-bridge-2019' as the “Repository URL” and click “Create Project” (you can choose the directory in which to place the project with the “Create project as subdirectory of” option). It should create a “r-bridge-2019” directory with all of the materials within whichever directory you chose. To open one of the R Markdown files, go to the lower right panel, click on 'Files', then 'r-bridge-2019', then 'modules' and finally click on the .Rmd file of interest. It will open in the upper left panel.


Here is the [schedule for the R portion of the bridge program](https://github.com/berkeley-scf/r-bridge-2019/blob/master/schedule/schedule.pdf). 

For the presentation materials (including embedded demo code), see the html files in *modules*. The *_slides_* files have individual pages, while the other html files are one continuous page per module. To run the demo code, open the .Rmd file for the module in RStudio. You can then run individual chunks of code.

## Preparing for the course - software installation

Please come with a fully-charged laptop (Mac, Windows, or Linux are all ok) with R and RStudio. RStudio is optional but highly recommended. 

To install the software, it's best if you can install software directly on your laptop.

  - Install the following directly on your laptop:
  
      - R [(details here)](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/berkeley-scf/r-bridge-2019/blob/master/install/RandRStudioInstall.html)
      - RStudio (optional but highly recommended) [(details here)](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/berkeley-scf/r-bridge-2019/blob/master/install/RandRStudioInstall.html)

Alternatively, IF INSTALLING ON YOUR LAPTOP FAILS, the following is an alternative way to access R and RStudio through a browser:

  - Please use your CalNet ID and password to login [here](https://r.datahub.berkeley.edu) (click on 'Sign in with bCourses' and enter your CalNet information). Once logged in, you should be in an RStudio session in the browser. At this point you can get a copy of the bootcamp files that your RStudio session can access by following instruction #1 above under the section "Preparing for the course - course content".

Note that our ability to troubleshoot R or RStudio installed directly on your machine is limited (particularly in Windows). We'll try to help, but if we run into roadblocks, we'll direct you to the browser option.
